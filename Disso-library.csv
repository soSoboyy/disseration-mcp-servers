The first step for hackers to conduct attacks is information collection. In this stage, Nmap is one of the most widely used scanning tools to obtain information from the target host. The obtained information can be further analyzed to assist in the subsequent attack. Therefore, it is necessary to find an efficient way to detect Nmap scanning behavior. ET OPEN is a rule set widely used by the intrusion detection system (IDS) to protect hosts from malicious penetration. The Nmap detection rate is 58.3% with ET OPEN rules, but it becomes 8.3% when facing IDS evasion. Due to the low detection rate of ET OPEN, we propose the Comprehensive Nmap Detection Rules (CNDR). CNDR can detect the Nmap scanning behaviors precisely and efficiently. In the CNDR, Nmap's customizable fields are removed, and rules for operating system scanning are added. CNDR achieves 100% detection rate of normal Nmap scanning and 91.7% detection accuracy of Nmap with IDS evasion on our designed dataset. The result shows CNDR is robust even facing customized scanning and is superior to ET OPEN.","2020-10","2024-10-22 21:41:54","2024-10-22 21:41:54","2024-10-22 21:41:54","64-71","","","","","","A Comprehensive Detection Approach of Nmap","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/shoggyboy/Zotero/storage/DGPUIBZZ/Liao et al. - 2020 - A Comprehensive Detection Approach of Nmap Princi.pdf; /Users/shoggyboy/Zotero/storage/CMXKKPQL/9329410.html","","","CNDR; ET OPEN; Intrusion detection; Knowledge discovery; Nmap; Operating systems; Reconnaissance; Software; Telecommunication traffic; Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, computer network technology has also exposed some problems while providing convenience to people's lives. For example, the resulting information security issues pose a threat to people's personal privacy, corporate security, national security, etc., thereby affecting the sustainable development of computer network technology. Based on this, we must strengthen the research on computer network security. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the research on the phenomenon of computer network information leakage and its causes, and strengthen the computer network security management. At the same time, we should also take necessary preventive measures from both technical and management aspects to ensure the safety of computer network information and reduce computer network threats. In view of this, this article will analyze and explore the current factors affecting computer network security on the basis of related concepts of computer network information security.

However, it is a common attack faced by companies and institutions, among others. It enables the attacker or penetration tester to gain valuable information on the target and select the best tools and methods that would make the attack successful. This study aims to identify and review existing state-of-the-art methodology for reconnaissance attacks based on certain techniques and evaluation metrics which will be beneficial to professional, ethical hackers in selecting the best-fit tool for a successful reconnaissance attack and enlighten organizations and the general public of the potential harm of a successful reconnaissance attack. This study explored seven online databases, which include Springer, Elsevier, Wiley, IEEE, ACM, ArXiv and Google Scholar. A total of 1306 publications were retrieved. Several screening criteria were executed to select relevant articles. Finally, 19 articles were identified for in-depth analysis. A quantitative evaluation was conducted on the selected articles using two search strategies: Techniques and source. A Quantitative Analysis (QA) was conducted on the selected articles and the outcome based on existing reconnaissance tools shows that 95.2% of the tools allowed experts to gather information by running their necessary command from the command line. While 4.8% of the tools do not provide a command-line interface allowing users to launch it from the command line interface while specifying some parameters to customize how it runs. 61.9% of the tools are network-based as they can be used to gather about the target's network infrastructure such as protocols, ports, DNS, IP address, hosts and the general network architecture. At the same time, 28.5% could be classified as hybrid as they allow the attacker to gather system-based and network-based information. This study concludes with findings that show that some of the tools operate in a different capacity; the best-fit tool is massively dependent on the attacker or penetration tester and the scenario's situations. Therefore, a tool should be selected based on the user's preference and the attack style.","2022-03-16","2024-10-23 14:53:05","2024-10-23 14:53:05","","103-115","","","18","","Journal of Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/shoggyboy/Zotero/storage/SIKGMYMN/Odun-Ayo et al. - 2022 - Evaluating Common Reconnaissance Tools and Techniq.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359367917_Evaluating_Common_Reconnaissance_Tools_and_Techniques_for_Information_Gathering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The capabilities of cybercriminals are expanding as they adopt new technologies like zero-day exploits or new business models such as hacker-as-a-service. While AI capabilities can improve cybersecurity measures, this same technology can also be utilized as an offensive cyber weapon to create sophisticated and intricate cyber-attacks. This paper describes an AI-powered mechanism for the automatic generation of attack techniques, ranging from initial attack vectors to impact-related actions. It presents a comprehensive analysis of simulated attacks by highlighting the attack tactics and techniques that are more likely to be generated using AI technology, specifically Large Language Model (LLM) technology. The work empirically demonstrates that LLM technology can be easily used by cybercriminals for attack execution. Moreover, the solution can complement Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) platforms and frameworks that automate the security assessment in a controlled manner. BAS could be enhanced with AI-powered attack simulation by bringing forth new ways to automatically program multiple attack techniques, even multiple versions of the same attack technique. Therefore, AI-enhanced attack simulation can assist in ensuring digital systems are bulletproof and protected against a great variety of attack vectors and actions.","2024-12","2025-08-06 15:18:50","2025-08-06 15:18:50","","104077-104077","","","147","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Advanced Technology","","","","Artificial intelligence; Cybersecurity; Large Language Model; Offensive AI; Risk assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A field that might benefit from such an approach is artificial intelligence (AI) research, where the number of scientific publications has been growing exponentially over recent years, making it challenging for human researchers to keep track of the progress. Here we use AI techniques to predict the future research directions of AI itself. We introduce a graph-based benchmark based on real-world data—the Science4Cast benchmark, which aims to predict the future state of an evolving semantic network of AI. For that, we use more than 143,000 research papers and build up a knowledge network with more than 64,000 concept nodes. We then present ten diverse methods to tackle this task, ranging from pure statistical to pure learning methods. Surprisingly, the most powerful methods use a carefully curated set of network features, rather than an end-to-end AI approach. These results indicate a great potential that can be unleashed for purely ML approaches without human knowledge. Ultimately, better predictions of new future research directions will be a crucial component of more advanced research suggestion tools.","2023-11","2025-08-06 15:18:51","2025-08-06 15:18:51","","1326-1335","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Nature Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Real cyberattacks are often multi-host network attacks, which involve executing a number of steps across multiple hosts such as conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities, and using compromised hosts to exfiltrate data. To date, the extent to which LLMs can autonomously execute multi-host network attacks} is not well understood. To this end, our first contribution is MHBench, an open-source multi-host attack benchmark with 10 realistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts). We find that popular LLMs including modern reasoning models (e.g., GPT4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking) with state-of-art security-relevant prompting strategies (e.g., PentestGPT, CyberSecEval3) cannot autonomously execute multi-host network attacks. To enable LLMs to autonomously execute such attacks, our second contribution is Incalmo, an high-level abstraction layer. Incalmo enables LLMs to specify high-level actions (e.g., infect a host, scan a network). Incalmo's translation layer converts these actions into lower-level primitives (e.g., commands to exploit tools) through expert agents. In 9 out of 10 networks in MHBench, LLMs using Incalmo achieve at least some of the attack goals. Even smaller LLMs (e.g., Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2 Flash) equipped with Incalmo achieve all goals in 5 of 10 environments. We also validate the key role of high-level actions in Incalmo's abstraction in enabling LLMs to autonomously execute such attacks.","2025-01","2025-08-06 15:18:51","2025-08-06 15:18:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits.

They pose a significant threat to Internet’s communications and applications. A botnet relies on command and control (C2) communications channels traffic between its members for its attack execution. C2 traffic occurs prior to any attack; hence, the detection of botnet’s C2 traffic enables the detection of members of the botnet before any real harm happens. We analyze C2 traffic and find that it exhibits a periodic behavior. This is due to the pre-programmed behavior of bots that check for updates to download them every T seconds. We exploit this periodic behavior to detect C2 traffic. The detection involves evaluating the periodogram of the monitored traffic. Then applying Walker’s large sample test to the periodogram’s maximum ordinate in order to determine if it is due to a periodic component or not. If the periodogram of the monitored traffic contains a periodic component, then it is highly likely that it is due to a bot’s C2 traffic. The test looks only at aggregate control plane traffic behavior, which makes it more scalable than techniques that involve deep packet inspection (DPI) or tracking the communication flows of different hosts. We apply the test to two types of botnet, tinyP2P and IRC that are generated by SLINGbot. We verify the periodic behavior of their C2 traffic and compare it to the results we get on real traffic that is obtained from a secured enterprise network. We further study the characteristics of the test in the presence of injected HTTP background traffic and the effect of the duty cycle on the periodic behavior.","2014-07-01","2025-08-08 10:47:43","2025-08-08 10:47:43","2025-08-08 10:47:43","435-448","","4","5","","Journal of Advanced Research","","Cyber Security","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/shoggyboy/Zotero/storage/YNZFTCMZ/AsSadhan and Moura - 2014 - An efficient method to detect periodic behavior in.pdf; /Users/shoggyboy/Zotero/storage/UGMG6L7N/S2090123213001410.html","","","Botnet detection; Control plane traffic; Discrete time series analysis; SLINGbot; Walker large sample test","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the same capabilities that make AI effective in protecting systems can also be used by attackers to launch sophisticated and complex cyberattacks. In this paper, the author conducted a systematic literature review to identify recent AI-driven cyberattacks and their characteristics, which could be used by cybersecurity experts to develop effective countermeasures. Preliminary findings indicate that some of the AI-driven attack types include data manipulation attacks (e.g. AI model data misclassification), access and penetration attacks (e.g. automated payload generation), and social engineering attacks (e.g. custom-made phishing). The paper also provides recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to promote cybersecurity best practices, educate the public, and encourage international cooperation. Future research could delve deeper into the technical aspects of AI-driven cyberthreats and the strategies and techniques utilised to combat them.

However, positive tools can also be used for negative purposes. In particular, cyber adversaries can use AI to enhance their attacks and expand their campaigns. Although offensive AI has been discussed in the past, there is a need to analyze and understand the threat in the context of organizations. For example, how does an AI-capable adversary impact the cyber kill chain? Does AI benefit the attacker more than the defender? What are the most significant AI threats facing organizations today and what will be their impact on the future? In this study, we explore the threat of offensive AI on organizations. First, we present the background and discuss how AI changes the adversary’s methods, strategies, goals, and overall attack model. Then, through a literature review, we identify 32 offensive AI capabilities which adversaries can use to enhance their attacks.

Although these AI technologies offer significant benefits, they can be used maliciously. Highly targeted and evasive attacks in benign carrier applications, such as DeepLocker, have demonstrated the intentional use of AI for harmful purposes. Threat actors are constantly changing and improving their attack strategy with particular emphasis on the application of AI-driven techniques in the attack process, called AI-based cyber attack, which can be used in conjunction with conventional attack techniques to cause greater damage. Despite several studies on AI and security, researchers have not summarized AI-based cyber attacks enough to be able to understand the adversary’s actions and to develop proper defenses against such attacks. This study aims to explore existing studies of AI-based cyber attacks and to map them onto a proposed framework, providing insight into new threats. Our framework includes the classification of several aspects of malicious uses of AI during the cyber attack life cycle and provides a basis for their detection to predict future threats. We also explain how to apply this framework to analyze AI-based cyber attacks in a hypothetical scenario of a critical smart grid infrastructure.","2020-02-06","2025-08-12 11:25:31","2025-08-12 11:25:31","2025-08-12 11:25:30","20:1–20:34","","1","53","","","The AI-Based Cyber Threat Landscape","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent agents, but they mainly focus on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse scenarios. Due to the versatile capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many researchers have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and have achieved significant progress. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey on LLM-based agents. We start by tracing the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs are suitable foundations for agents. Building upon this, we present a general framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored for different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent societies, exploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the social phenomena that emerge from an agent society, and the insights they offer for human society. Finally, we discuss several key topics and open problems within the field.

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast, Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration layers, and causal modeling.

Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).","2018","2025-08-18 11:00:38","2025-08-18 11:02:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/shoggyboy/Zotero/storage/RUCRZWMB/Radford et al. - Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
